        I am a Principal Measurement Technician with a passion for
        <b
          >3D laser scanning, scan data processing, programming, and 3D CAD
          modeling</b
        >
        in the petrochemical industry. With sixteen years of experience, I've
        honed my skills in scanning and land surveying techniques and equipment
        to ensure precise scan model accuracy and proper alignment with
        client-specified plant coordinates. I take pride in my attention to
        detail and technical expertise, transforming complex data into valuable
        insights.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond the technical work, I manage various aspects of 3D laser scanning
        projects, from scoping jobs and preparing quotations to mentoring and
        training junior scan technicians. I also oversee the calibration and
        maintenance of our scanning and land surveying equipment, ensuring
        optimal performance. A significant part of my role involves processing
        large volumes of scan data using multiple software platforms to create
        accurate models and data formats tailored to each client's needs.
        Additionally, I am passionate about programming and problem-solving,
        always seeking ways to streamline workflows and enhance productivity
        through automation and efficient coding solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of work, I'm a dedicated husband and father, and
        <b>my family is my greatest inspiration.</b> I cherish spending quality
        time with them and always strive to be a positive role model. I also
        prioritize fitness, as my morning gym sessions keep me motivated and
        energized for the day ahead.
